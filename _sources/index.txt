Launch & Provision Internal API 
===============================

REST API to launch and provision instances on EC2.  This is an internal-only API designed to be used by other infrastructure components to manage the infrastructure.  There is a separate external API for user interaction.  This functionality is designed as an API for scalability and to enable components written in multiple languages to have a single interface for infrastructure commands.
